# HALT Marker Documentation

This file serves as a control mechanism for AI agents (particularly Codex) working on this repository.

## Purpose

The HALT marker system ensures that:
1. AI agents follow the step-by-step roadmap defined in Master System Documentation.md
2. Each step is completed fully before proceeding to the next
3. All changes are logged in codex_log.md before committing
4. Human oversight is maintained throughout the process

## How It Works

When this file is present, AI agents must:
- ✅ Read and confirm Master System Documentation.md roadmap
- ✅ Execute only one step at a time
- ✅ Test all changes completely
- ✅ Log everything in codex_log.md
- ✅ Commit with step format: "Step N: [description]"
- ✅ STOP and wait for human review before next step

## Control Commands

- **HALT**: Stop all AI execution immediately
- **PROCEED**: Allow next step execution (human approval required)
- **RESET**: Return to previous known good state

## Emergency Override

If AI agents become unresponsive to HALT commands:
1. Delete this file to disable the framework
2. Use git reset to previous commit
3. Contact system administrator
