# Data Directory

This directory contains system data and runtime files for the Spatial Constellation System.

```

## Usage

### Logs Directory (`logs/`)
- Contains system logs and process management files
- PID files track running system components
- Log files provide debugging and monitoring information

### Workspace Directory (`workspace/`)
- Safe sandbox for AI file operations
- Local LLM has read/write access here
- Files deleted by AI are moved to `.trash` (never permanently deleted)

### Conversations Directory (`conversations/`)
- Contains exported conversation files from memory system
- JSON format exports for backup and analysis
- Generated by `memory export` command

## File Permissions

- **All models** can read files from anywhere on the system
- **Local LLM only** can write/create/delete files in the workspace
- **ChatGPT/Claude** have read-only access everywhere

## Maintenance

### Log Rotation
System logs may grow over time. Consider rotating them periodically:
```bash
mv data/logs/system.log data/logs/system.log.old
touch data/logs/system.log
```

### Workspace Cleanup
The workspace `.trash` directory will accumulate deleted files:
```bash
rm -rf data/workspace/.trash/*  # Permanently delete if desired
```

### Conversation Export Cleanup
Old conversation exports can be cleaned up as needed:
```bash
find data/conversations/ -name "*.json" -mtime +30 -delete  # Delete exports older than 30 days
```
